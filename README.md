# DTSSignals.jl

A repository for an educational package  on discrete time signals.

Signals are "parallel" vectors of time indices and values, possibly with a sampling frequency associated to them to ground the information. 

There are many ways this could be used for your classes in Discrete Time Signal Processing.
